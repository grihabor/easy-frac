# easy-frac
##Usage
python run.py
##Description
Little script for fractal generation using [**Iterated Function System**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system) (**IFS**). You can change size, number of iterations, color function, rotation and position of the fractal. There some precreated fractal functions in file **frac.py** like **minkowski_curve** or **sierpinski_triangle** but you can make your own generator function. Fractal is generated in the buffer you offer, so you can make several fractals on the same image, you can save or show the image afterwards or do whatever you like.
